# AI and Data Science in Python from Scratch

## Style of notebooks
I write the notebooks to contain:

1) Intuition

2) Mathematics and Statistics behind the tool/algorithm

3) Code implementation from scratch (using numpy)

4) Application to real (publicly available) data

If you spot any mistakes in the code or the theory, feel free to raise an issue. 

## Inpspiration

This Program is inspired by (**Make sure you read in the order mentioned below in order to get an intuitive knowledge of the subject. Let's Build the Intuition**) :

    - Machine Learning for Humans by Vishal Saini and Samir Sabri
    - The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book by Andriy Burkov
    - An Introduction to Statistical Learning - Gareth James Daniela Witten Trevor Hastie Robert Tibshirani
    - Coursera Deep Learning Course by Andrew Ng
    - Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville
    - Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach
