# Investigating Experimental Data Using Linear Regression

## Purpose
We examine the effects of class size reduction on math achievement using a publicly available experimental data set using linear regression. The notebook also explores whether the effect of class size reduction varies by teacher experience. The PDF file contains slides discussing analysis of experimental data using linear regression.

## Data
From 1985-1989 the state of Tennessee conducted a experiment to examine the causal impacts of smaller class sizes on student test scores. The data set from this study is now publicly available and can be found on dataverse. I use a kindergarten subset of this data set.

## Dependencies
* numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

All dependencies can be installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

## Contribution Opportunities
At the end of the notebook I suggest multiple extensions, feel free to implement them in the notebook and do a pull request.
