## Purpose
The "Linear Regression.ipynb" notebook discusses linear regression as a method to model the statistical relationship between and out Y and predictor(s) X. I discuss how the linear regression relates to the conditional expectation function. 

My notes on linear regression related to this notebook can be found in "Linear Regression Note.pdf"

## Data
Linear regression is used to model the relationship between the number of goals scored and attempted shots on net in FIFA. I use the [FIFA 2018 data set](https://www.kaggle.com/mathan/fifa-2018-match-statistics) from kaggle:

## Dependencies
* numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

All dependencies can be installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

## Contribution Ideas
If anyone is interested in working further on improving this notebook, here are some ideas:
* I am fimiliar with linear regression, so I didn't look into many references. Feel free to update references below with good quality relevant notes/videos. 
* Compare linear regression and CEF with two explantory variables. This will require 3D plots.
