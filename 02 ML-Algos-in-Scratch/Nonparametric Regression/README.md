# Purpose

Explain and implement nonparametric regressions from scratch. The "Nonparametric Regression.ipynb" notebook discusses how to estimate the nonparametric component of the model: Y = f(x) + e. Polynomial approximation, Gaussian kernel regression, and spline regression are discussed. 

# Dependencies
* numpy
* Matplotlib

All dependencies can be installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

# Contribution ideas

If anyone is interested in working further on improving this notebook, here are some ideas:
* Application to real data with nonlinearities
* Discuss and implement cross validation to choose the tuning parameters
* Discuss and implement other estimation methods such as locally weighted regression
